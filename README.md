# startwifi
Simple bash script for connecting to a wpa encrypted wifi access point in an arch linux environment
- Must have wpa_supplicant installed
- Must be run as root
- Run with no arguments for a "Usage" statement
- Made this for myself as a wrapper for wpa_supplicant for my own convienience, if you have any contributions to make ( i.e searching for installed driver and autoselecting it or something) feel free to submit a PR I will probably accept, but this works for me and thats all it was really intended for
